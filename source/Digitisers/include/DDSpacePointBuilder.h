/** ================= FTD Space Point Builder =================
 * 
 * Builds space points for pairs of silicon strip detectors. 
 * The digitisers create TrackerHitPlanars for the front and the back strips. 
 * In order to get a spacepoint (as is needed by track reconstruction) those strip measurements need to be combined into one space point.
 * 
 * This is done by this processor. 
 * 
 *  <h4>Input - Prerequisites</h4>
 *  
 * The TrackerHitPlanars as created by the Digitisers of FTD, SET or SIT. 
 * This could of course be used for other detectors as well, but as information about the detector
 * is acquired from DDRec, and as different detectors (at the moment) are stored differently
 * in DDRec, used detectors have to be taken care of in the code.
 *
 *  <h4>Output</h4> 
 *  
 * A collection of TrackerHits containing the constructed space points.
 * The created hits will store the original strip hits in their rawHits. 
 * 
 * @param TrackerHitCollection The name of the input collection of TrackerHits coming from strip detectors on the FTD, SIT or SET <br>
 * (default name FTDTrackerHits) <br>
 * 
 * @param SpacePointsCollection The name of the output collection of the created spacepoints <br>
 * (default name FTDSpacePoints) <br>
 * 
 * @param TrackerHitSimHitRelCollection The name of the input collection of the relations of the TrackerHits to SimHits<br>
 * (default name FTDTrackerHitRelations)<br>
 * 
 * @param SimHitSpacePointRelCollection The name of the SpacePoint SimTrackerHit relation output collection <br>
